                 Between 08:00 and 21:00 each day during the Promotion Period, visit <a class="link" href="/">treborcash.com</a> enter your details and scan the front of a Participating Product with the Trebor logo for the chance to win.</p>
              <p class="text">All winners will be selected by random winning moments (date, hours, minutes, seconds), 1,365 of which have been randomly and securely selected by an independent adjudicator within the Promotion Period to win one of the prizes. 3 prizes are available to be won per hour. All entrants will have an equal chance of winning across the prize pool. Those registrants who scan a Participating Product on or first after one of these winning moments will win a Prize. If no one scans a Participating Product within a winning moment timeframe, the available Prize will roll into the next moment or next day of the promotion so that the Prize may still be won i.e. if a winning moment occurs at 21:00 on one day and no scans take place during the winning moment timeframe, a Participating Product scanned at 08.00 the next day will capture that winning moment. In the event that there are no entries received within a given period between two or more winning moments, the relevant Prize(s) will be rolled forward and awarded to the next available entrant(s). Once an entrant has scanned a Participating Product, a window will instantly pop-out informing them whether they are a winner or not.</p>
